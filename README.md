# Working with a geopackage (.gpkg) in QGIS

The spatial information of the watherseds is likely stored as a shapefile (.shp) or a geodatabase (.gdb), or any other format (e.g., .geotiff). The JoeModelCE package (and app) uses the geopackage  format (gpkg), which is an open format for geospatial information that describes a set of conventions for storing information within an SQLite database such as vector features, tile matrix sets of imagery and raster maps at various scales, attributes (non-spatial data) and extensions. As such, the user needs to convert the spatial information as a “geopackage” in order to upload it in the “Watershed Polygons” tab.

In this repository you will find a description of how to accomplish this task using the open-source geographic information system (GIS) software, QGIS.

* Convert existing format into “.gpkg”

* Edit/customize the “.gpkg”
